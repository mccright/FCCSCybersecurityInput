# FCCSCybersecurityInput  

These are some of my initial random notes while reading for an FCCS session on cybersecurity.  

These are my notes and copies of quotes.  
Nothing here is unique or new.  
There are no academic-quality citations -- only titles, authors (where known) and links to source resources.  

Expect this content to evolve.
