# FCCSCybersecurityInput  

This content was assembled in response to a question about cybersecurity from staff involved in a public school teacher training course led by University of Northern Iowa.  They wanted some input about cybersecurity to support highlighting the topic in their 'foundational concepts of computer science' curriculum.

These are some of my initial random notes while reading for an FCCS session on cybersecurity.  
...notes and copies of quotes.  
Nothing here is unique or new.  
There are no academic-quality citations -- only titles, authors (where known) and links to source resources.  

See the wiki [https://github.com/mccright/FCCSCybersecurityInput/wiki](https://github.com/mccright/FCCSCybersecurityInput/wiki)  

Expect this content to evolve.
