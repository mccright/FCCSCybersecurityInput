# FCCSCybersecurityInput  

In response to a question about cybersecurity from staff involved a course led by University of Northern Iowa about foundational concepts of computer science, I assembled these notes about cybersecurity to support introducing some highlights into that computer science curriculum.

These are some of my initial random notes while reading for an FCCS session on cybersecurity.  
...notes and copies of quotes.  
Nothing here is unique or new.  
There are no academic-quality citations -- only titles, authors (where known) and links to source resources.  

See the wiki [https://github.com/mccright/FCCSCybersecurityInput/wiki](https://github.com/mccright/FCCSCybersecurityInput/wiki)  

Expect this content to evolve.
