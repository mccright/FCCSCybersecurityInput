## Risk Management-Relevant Architectural Qualities
---------------------------------------------------
1. Security -- (need an "ility" here) Defense in Depth  
2. Security -- Confidentiality  
3. Security -- Integrity  
4. Security -- Availability  
5. Security -- Authenticity  
6. Security -- Proportionality  
7. Security -- Auditability  
8. Security -- "Assurability" (Assurance)  
 a. Security -- Verifiability  
 b. Security -- Testability  
 c. Security -- Visibility  
 d. Security -- Repeatability  
 e. Security -- Reproducibility  
 f. Security -- Representativeness   
 g. Security -- Predictability  
 h. Security -- Reliability (Not-contaminated, industry-accepted tools & techniques)  
9. Security -- (need an "ility" here) Least Privilege  
10. Security -- Accountability  
11. Security -- Non-deniability (Non-repudiation)  
 a. Security -- Linkability (Evidence, or creation & maintenance of accountability)  
12. Security -- Applicability (Real & relevant evidence)  
13. Security -- User-perceived security  
 a. Security -- Familiarity (Knowledge and awareness)  
 b. Security -- Believability (Evidence)  
 c. Security -- Admissibility (Evidence)  
 d. Security -- Receivability (Presentable & understandability)  
14. Security -- Modifiability (As in, static or brittle architectures and implementations introduce more risk per unit of change)  
 a. Security -- Evolvability  
 b. Security -- Extensibility  
 c. Security -- Customizability  
 d. Security -- Configurability  
 e. Security -- Maintainability  
15. Security -- Anonymity (Anonymity and accountability are extremes on the linkability continuum)  
*Those below seem less generally applicable in some industries, but still highly relevant -- even core -- to others*  
16. Security -- Unobservability  
17. Security -- Pseudonymity  
18. Security -- Unlinkability (Attacker cannot identify linkage after observing items of interest, that were not already known prior to that observation.)  
*And finally, the issues below need more work to tease out their relevant 'ilities.  Let me know if you have some repairs.*  
19. Security - (need an "ility" here) Self-Preservation  
20. Security - (need an "ility" here) Compartmentalization  
21. Security - (need an "ility" here) Procedures  
22. Security - (need an "ility" here) Technical safeguards  
23. Security - (need an "ility" here) Personnel  
24. Security - (need an "ility" here) Legal/regulatory compliance  
25. Security - (need an "ility" here) Incident handling  
26. Security - (need an "ility" here) Physical Security  
27. Security - (need an "ility" here) Risk Management (life-cycle)  
28. Security - (need an "ility" here) Security Policy & Standards  

Matt McCright collected and assembled the above material from numerous sources over the last decade.  This list is not an attempt to identify what is important for every project, rather to provide a resource that project participants (*when engaged in planning, architecting, designing, product or component evaluation, coding, etc.*) could use when they attempt to make the hard choices about what are the most important for the project at hand.
